## 🐞 Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, please include:
- A **clear title** (e.g. “Parsing fails when regional number format includes commas”)
- Description of what you expected vs what happened
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Any error messages or unusual output
- (Optional) Your Windows locale or regional settings if relevant

Example:
> The script fails to parse size when numbers include commas like “1,234,567”. The threshold prompt then misbehaves…
